					<h3>Part 1: Bookmarking Service</h3><br/>

						<p display="inline">For this part of the assignment, we were to create an online bookmarking service to store a list of URLs. It should allow users to be able to add, edit, and delete any websites. While doing so the service will always check if the URL entered is a valid website.</p><br/>
						<p>Before logging in, you will be shown the Top 10 list (up to 10, less if not enough) of the most popular URLs that other users have added to their lists. You can begin by logging into an existing account or signing up as a new user. Once logged in, you can modify your url lists!</p><br/>
						<p>This part was done using html, css, javascript/jquery, and php. I first created the various pages and then worked through the homepage followed by the individual user pages. This part accesses the MySQL database that is set up on the server. </p><br>
						<p>There are two tables:
						<ol>
							<li>Users: Username (Primary Key), Password</li>
							<li>Bookmarks: BookmarkID (Primary Key), Url, User (Foreign Key)</li>
						</ol></p><br>
						<p>This part of the assignment was created using a lot of dynamic DOM manipulations to transform the visual GUI of the website while asynchronously posting and getting php requests to the server. It also makes use of cookies in order to keep the user logged in.</p>

					<h3>Part 2: Online Learning Management</h3><br/>

						<p display="inline">For this part of the assignment, we were to create EML Learning Service. This is to parse an XML file from a client and uploads the content to MySQL tables. As a user, you may select a unit to view and complete a quiz on!</p><br/>
						<p>You may log in or sign up. Once logged in you will see the units that can be accessed (3 total). Each Unit is stored in the database and PHP is used to fetch and display all of the data properly. Once done you may compelte a quiz and this will show your result. I had queried and parsed the data using PHP and Javascript/JQuery.</p><br/>
						<p>There are six tables:
						<ol>
							<li>Units: ID (Primary Key), Title, Overview</li>
							<li>Chapters: ID (Primary Key), Title, Overview, UnitID (Foreign Key)</li>
							<li>Sections: ID (Primary Key), Title, Content, ChapterID (Foreign Key)</li>
							<li>Quizzes: ID (Primary Key), Title, UnitID (Foreign Key)</li>
							<li>QuizQuestion: ID (Primary Key), Question, QuizID (Foreign Key)</li>
							<li>QuizAnswers: ID (Primary Key), Answer, Correct (flag), QuestionID (Foreign Key)</li>
						</ol></p><br>
						<p>This project had many compnent dealing with parsing .xml to the database and database to HTML!</p><br/>
