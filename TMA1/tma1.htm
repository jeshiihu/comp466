	<h2>Documentation:</h2>
	<h3>Original Description and Requirements: 
		<a href="assignment_1.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
	<h3>Interpretation Of Requirement</h3>
	<p>For this assignment, our skills in Web Development was tested. The following tasks were required:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Part 1: Create a XML version of our Resumes and be able to display it in a webpage</li>
		<li>Part 2: Provide a multi-page tutorial website with interactive quizzes</li>
		<li>Part 3: Display a photo slideshow that is manageable with JSON</li>
		<li>Part 4: Create a webpage that has multiple utilities tools suite</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>My Implementation</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Part 1: I started out simply transforming my resume into an XML and then writing the xsl for it to be shown in a webbrowser. After that I set up my TMA1 web pages and ensured it was accessible.</li>
		<li>Part 2: This part took most of my time, I had setup the general outline of each unit and their quizzes with HTML5 and CSS. I then worked on the quiz system which includes XML, Javascript, and AJAX. After this I populated the tutorials and quizzes.</li>
		<li>Part 3: I collected photos from my co-op term in Burnaby, BC. I create the JSON array and made a simple slide show. I then developed the play and stop and next/prev buttons. After that I spend time on the effects! This was done with HTML5 and Javascript</li>
		<li>Part 4: This was quite straightforward using input HTML5 elements and Javascript, where the calculations are. For the values of conversion for weight, I used the one on google.ca. The mortgage calculator was based off of this <a href="http://mortgage.lovetoknow.com/Calculate_Mortgage_Payments_Formula">website</a>. Lastly I thought that a tip calulator would be extremely useful. It simply allows users to be able to calculate their total bill based on tip percentage or tip amount.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>How to navigate and view the assignment?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>If using Chrome, I would use the steps provided or use XAMPP to set up a local host
		<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/33801287">here</a>, in order to view everything properly. The steps in the provided answer starts a local http server in order to display XML content from local files. This is blocked in Chrome for security reasons.
		</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Run the commands (in the link) in your terminal</li>
			<li>Type 'http://localhost:8000/' into your browser and navigate to tma1.htm</li>
		</ol>
		<li>For the other browsers, opening tma1.htm in a browser will work!</li>
		<li>Each page will have buttons and a banner that will allow you to navigate between pages.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Thank you Dr. Harris for your help with clearing up my misunderstanding the quiz being editable by the user! That made be blocked for a long time before I realized and contacted you.</p>
